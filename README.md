Simple karaoke app (Android)
==========

Simple karaoke app using RESTful web service with JSON. Lyrics are synced with the song and displayed at defined timestamps.

Android Studio Project.

Note that the web service providing the app with JSON data is inactive. So you have to create another Google App Engine web service to provide the app with JSON data about the songs and lyrics.
